# Pepe's Blockchain Beginnings

At the same time all of the Pepe controversy was happening over the years, there was a growing community of Pepe fans trying to reclaim the meme in their own way, **using blockchain technology**.

## The Announcement

It's the 14 septembre 2016, that "billybob2014" has announced, on the crypto forum [Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1617264.0) : **"The first truly rare Pepes on the Bitcoin Blockchain!"**. What have started as a it's "_own little personal project to release_ [it's] _own rare Pepe cards for fun on Counterparty_" will transform into a collective project as he "_quickly realized that_ [he] _wasn't going to be the only one that wanted to make Pepes. So instead _[he]_ created a pepe directory for people to submit their Pepe's to_"[^1] This announcement is made at least one month later the effective beginning of the submission process, as it's states that
> "_In about a month of Submissions we have reached over 300 Pepe's from artists all over the world_."


The post present the "the first Pepe"_  ever created for the directory : [RAREPEPE](http://rarepepedirectory.com/?p=10),which was issued at 300 units and another one [PEPECASH](http://rarepepedirectory.com/?p=65), issued in a much larger quantity (at the time, 701884009 units was left in circulation [^2]) and for reason, it's have to be the corner stone of the Rare Pepe economy : it's own currency, serving for submission fees and trading. 
> PEPECASH is just like any other card except its alot more liquid. Its also what is used to pay the submission fee into the RarePepe directory", (billybob2014,[Bitcointalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1617264.0))

###The submission : it's process & rules 

People could started creating pictures of Pepe, similar to collectible cards and have to follow some rules to submit their creation to the directory


tokenizing them on the blockchain.

Some Pepes were memes from 4chan, some were superhero knockoffs, some were even political Pepes."

They were named **Rare Pepes.**

"After being approved in the directory, their pepe's appear in the Rare Pepe Wallet and can actually be traded for money"

These Rare Pepes would be traded amongst people, using cryptocurrency.

Soon, a platform for trading these collectibles, the “[RarePepeWallet](https://rarepepewallet.com/)”, was developed by [Joe Looney](https://twitter.com/wasthatawolf).

One user even managed to make a profit to buy a yacht which he named “[The SS Rare Pepe](https://www.vice.com/en/article/yw5axg/pepecash-millionaire-yacht-cryptocurrency-rare-pepes)”.\
The individual has lived on the yacht ever since.

Fun fact: The yacht was bought with [PEPECASH](https://pepe.wtf/asset/PEPECASH), one of the tokenized Rare Pepe cards.
